When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

When you want to save a backup for your commits or collaborate with others.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Sometimes you don't want to be updated with your remote repository especially of others committed to that and want to keep your own.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

Fork: copy the repository to your own account on Github. Use it when you don't want to make changes to the original repository.

Clone: copy the whole repository to your local.

Branches: track different path of the commits on your local.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

To keep track of what you've already put on the remote.
